## start
start - Start a container or group. Pass docker compose flags after target name

Usage:
  ./scripts/dev-env start <target> [docker compose up options]

Examples:
  ./scripts/dev-env start app --watch
  ./scripts/dev-env start services -d
## stop

Usage:
  ./scripts/dev-env stop <target> [docker compose down options]

## test
test - Run tests in an isolated container. The container is deleted after test completes. Coverage is on by default unless test args are passed.

Usage:
  ./scripts/dev-env test <target> [docker compose run options] [--jest <jest options>] 

Examples:
  ./scripts/dev-env test api
  ./scripts/dev-env test api -q --jest --runInBand --testNamePattern='auth'
  ./scripts/dev-env test api --jest /app/server/api/tests/bootstrap/connectDb.test.js

- Use [--jest <jest options>] to customize Jest behavior.
## run
run - Run arbitrary commands in a utility container. These containers are deleted when done. Not specifying a command starts a shell.

Usage:
  ./scripts/dev-env run utils <command>
  ./scripts/dev-env run shell <command>

Examples:
  ./scripts/dev-env run utils -- npx eslint --ext .vue,.js .
  ./scripts/dev-env run utils -- npx prisma migrate dev 

## connect
connect - Open a shell in a running container

Usage:
  ./scripts/dev-env connect <target>
## status
status - Show container status

Usage:
  ./scripts/dev-env status
## targets

The `targets.json` file defines reusable container groups and command mappings.

"api": {        <-- Target Name
    "commands": ["test"],       <-- Supported commands
    "containers": ["unit-test"],        <-- Containers to use. If multiple, omit 'connect' command
    "jest_config": "server/api/tests/jest.config.mjs"       <-- Mandatory and supported for test targets only
}

It also supports a shorthand syntax as
"mongodb": ["start", "stop", "connect"]

which is equivalent to:
{
    "commands": [...],
    "containers": ["mongodb"]
}

If "containers" is omitted, it defaults to [target_name].
