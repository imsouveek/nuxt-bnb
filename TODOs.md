### Execution & Planning
- [ ] `ROADMAP.md` – Story-pointed feature roadmap with phases and prioritization logic
- [ ] `PERSONAS.md` – Key user personas and jobs-to-be-done
- [ ] `EXPERIMENTS.md` – Hypothetical A/B tests with hypotheses and success metrics
- [ ] `DECISIONS.md` – Product and architectural trade-offs with rationale

### Technical Empathy & Architecture
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` – System overview and component breakdown (with diagrams)
- [ ] `ANALYTICS.md` – Planned metrics, funnel tracking, and instrumentation plan

### Optional Enhancements
